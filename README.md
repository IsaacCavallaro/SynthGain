# Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.

- Currently, there are no online Marketplaces **dedicated** to **buying** and **selling vintage synthesizers.**

- The commonplace to buy and sell vintage synthesizers are *Ebay, Facebook Marketplace* and the online music marketplace *Reverb*. While each of these platforms are stable and allow users to buy and sell various music equipment, none of them specialise in buying and selling vintage synthesizers. In this manner, they each favour the **quantity of products** available over the **quality of products** they sell; compromising the standards of these transactions. This quantity over quality attitude demonstrated from the above-mentioned platforms misses the opportunity for a sincere community to develop. With a focus on the quantity of transactions and products, these platforms foster a transactional relationship between buyers and sellers to which *SythnGain* makes progress towards solving.

- As of 2021, Ebay has a total of 1.7 billion listings with 187 million eBay users worldwide. These numbers in conjunction with the quantity over quality attitude makes it difficult for Ebay to set up systems and protocols that successfully and reliably deliver musical instruments; specifically, musical instruments that are fragile and have many working parts. According to the GSP agreement on Ebay, if an item cannot be shipped due to size or regulations, Ebay can refund the buyer and resell the item. While this may seem an appropriate action to take, in many cases, buyers and sellers have been late to find out about such changes within the transaction and as a result, have been disappointed with the experience. Additionally, Ebay's terms may be amended at any time with a simple posting to the eBay site; to which such terms will take effect immediately. Clearly this is a necessary procedure for such a large enterprise though it further illustrates the implications of a quantity over quality model.

- Another example of the quantity over quality model is evident with the social media marketing platform Facebook hosting approximately 1.74 billion active users every month. Clearly this is an advantage if you are aiming to make quick sales and target are very large audience, but again, that does not foster a sincere community revolving around a central theme outside of transactions.

- Finally, the online marketplace *Reverb* is fundamentally a trusted and reliable source for users to buy and sell equipment. The site is led by musicians and includes protection policies for both the buyer and the seller. *Reverb* does provide an outlet to buy and sell vintage synthesizes however, this is one category among many instruments with each category of instruments having a wide range of factors that go into the selling and distribution.

- In summary, while each of the above mention platforms successfully allow users to buy and sell vintage synthesizers, each platform displays a prioritisation in the quantity of products available, or the quantity of transactions and as a result, misses the opportunity to create and maintain a community which revolves around a central theme. By aiming to solve the problem of buying and selling anything or all musical instruments, these platforms create other problems and make the error of thinking that limitations are somehow a negative quality.
